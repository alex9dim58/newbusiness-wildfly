# Eclipse Starter for Jakarta EE
This is a sample application generated by the Eclipse Foundation starter for Jakarta EE.

You can run the application by executing the following command from the directory where this file resides. 
Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE implementation](https://adoptium.net) appropriate for your 
Jakarta EE version and runtime choice (this sample assumes Java SE 21). Note, 
the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install 
is not actually needed. You may first need to execute `chmod +x mvnw`.

```
./mvnw clean package wildfly:run
```

Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at [http://localhost:8080/newbusiness-wildfly](http://localhost:8080/newbusiness-wildfly).

You can also run the project via Docker. To build the Docker image, execute the following commands from the 
directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed 
a [Java SE implementation](https://adoptium.net) appropriate for your Jakarta EE version/runtime 
choice (this sample assumes Java SE 21) and 
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Note, 
the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install 
is not actually needed. You may first need to execute `chmod +x mvnw`.

cd C:\workspaces\playground\Docker\newbusiness-wildfly
```
./mvnw clean package
docker build -t newbusiness-wildfly:v1 .
```

You can then run the Docker image by executing:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8081:8080 newbusiness-wildfly:v1
```

Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at [http://localhost:8081/newbusiness-wildfly](http://localhost:8081/newbusiness-wildfly).
